# {{ site.title }} - {{site.description}}

GangGo is a decentralized social network written in [GoLang](https://golang.org/). It uses the same federation library like [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) and therefore can participate in conversations like any other [Pod](https://the-federation.info/nodes)!

## Installation

<asciinema-player src="/assets/casts/installation.cast"></asciinema-player>
<script src="/assets/js/asciinema-player.js"></script>

<br />

<button class="github-link btn btn-outline-success"></button> and make it executable `chmod +x updater.linux-amd64.alpha`!

It comes with a small installation wizard :) Happy Federating!
