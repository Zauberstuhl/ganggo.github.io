GangGo is a decentralized social network written in [GoLang](https://golang.org/). It uses the same federation library like [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) and therefore can participate in conversations like any other [Pod](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Choosing_a_pod#Why_do_I_need_to_choose_a_pod.3F)!

> This is the application server repository. Which is still
> in pre-alpha state so please don't use it for production!
